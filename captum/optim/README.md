# captum-optim module

This is project began as an attempt to integrate the [tensorflow/lucid](https://github.com/tensorflow/lucid) library into the [pytorch/captum](https://github.com/pytorch/captum/) library. It implements numerous papers on feature visualization and interpretability.

See captum/tree/master-optim/tutorials/optimvis for examples of how to use this library module.
